### Gunshot Sounds ###

Next release (probably in 48hrs) will include the ability to mute or swap the gunshot sounds with quieter bangs or crossbow sfx.


### That Skill Is Not Ready text ###

If you want to remove the red text which shows every time you try to use skills when they're on cooldown, you'll have to either extract & edit your own tags_ui file, removing everything on the line after "tagSkillNotReady={^r}" - I'll have a button for this in the next update.


### Mutable Sounds List ###

* Wing Flaps (for Occultist Familiar)
* Wind Devil Loop
* Bugswarm Enemy Sound
* Blade Spirit Loops
* That insufferable sound of the Kodama pet casting Regrowth every 2secs

* Ambient - Flies Buzzing
* Ambient - Riftgate Crackling
* Ambient - Eldritch Rift Crackling

* "That skill's not ready" and "I can't do that yet"
